## NPO: Warrior Wives

### [Problem Statement](https://ohack.dev/project/goHifAZIzmCumLHRbiEP)
Military wives lack a secure and customized platform to connect with each other online. They have used Facebook Groups in the past, but they found it unsafe and unsatisfactory. They want to use the ID.me (or similar) verification process to ensure the identity and safety of the users. 

### About our solution
This a social platform for Warrior Wives.
This platform is built with security in mind as in the past, women of this community did not have a safe and secure platform with similar verified members of the community. On this platform, users can sign up and verify their identity using ID.me which ensures that they are who they say they are and belong to the military community. Users who are vetted are able to join groups based on their interests, branch of service and needs. Within these groups they will be able to check out and join events as well.

### How we built it
We built a website using NextJS and React, with Chakra UI as our UI library.

## Installation

Steps to run the project locally:
```
  In your terminal or code editor:
  - cd <directory you want to save files to>
  - git clone https://github.com/2023-opportunity-hack/ReactEnjoyers--FindYourTribeofWarriorWives-ASafeandEffectiveMatchingSystem.git
  - cd ReactEnjoyers--FindYourTribeofWarriorWives-ASafeandEffectiveMatchingSystem
  - npm install
  
  To run development server:
  - npm run dev

  To run production build:
  - npm build
  - npm start
```

## Features
- [x] User Authentication using ID.me
- [x] View and join groups based on interests, branch of service and needs
- [x] View and join events from groups

### Challenges we ran into
A big challenge we ran into is when testing ID.me, as ID.me does not provide sandbox (testing) credentials for testing on the fly. It requires us to contact their support team to give us permissions and obtain further information on how to set up a sandbox environment for testing purposes.

### What we learned
Planning is really important! We did not have time to plan and planned on the first day itself on which NPO problems to tackle and how we were going to do it.

### What's next for WarriorWives
We would love to continue working on this product to make it a fully furnished platform. There is definitely a lot of potential for this platform to be used by Warrior Wives in many different locations, helping them change their lives for the better.
